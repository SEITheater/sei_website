Great artists deserve great tools.  Great tools should help artists make decisions, not make decisons for them.  At SEI Theater we are dedicated to building tools that provide you with as much information as possible without interrupting your process.

A deep understanding of a theatrical text helps every production department.  But searching through a text to gather evidence to support a feeling you get from a text can be time consuming and limit how widely an artistic team experiments.

<a href="http://playanalyzer.com">PlayAnalyzer.com</a> can help adventurous artists explore a text in previously impossible ways.  By providing direct access to information that would normally have to be divined from years of experience working with theatrical texts, it helps artists make more informed decisions early in the production process so that they can create the most bold and daring of their visions.
