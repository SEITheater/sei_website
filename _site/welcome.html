Welcome to the online home of theater for the 21st century!
</div>

<p>Our mission is to strengthen and expand the theatrical community and cultural literacy in the dramatic arts through the creation of tools, programs and productions that expand the accessibility and increase the quality of theater nationwide.  On this website you’ll be able to find information about our upcoming productions, use free tools SEI Theater has developed for artists, and become involved in a nationwide theatrical community.</p>

<p>Theater is more important than it’s ever been before.  It connects people to each other and their communities, but the omnipresence of online content threatens to seperate us from communal experiences as never before.  We believe that lowering the barriers of entry to increassing ease of accessfor theatrical experiences is the best way to show what theater can offer that no other medium can and lay the foundations for a thriving theatrical community for the next generation.</p>
